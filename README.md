# GEOSPH
Geomechanics Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics 

GEOSPH is a computational numerical framework for geomechanics applications based on the numerical method called smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH).

The source code was built using the Python SPH framework developed by Ramachandran et al. (2021) - "SPH: A Python-Based Framework for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics," which can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.1145/3460773. 

GEOSPH was developed as part of Dr. Alomir Favero's doctoral research at Stanford University (USA). If you have any questions about the source code or usage of GEOSPH, please email Dr. Favero at alomir.favero@bucknell.edu

Also contributed to the code in its current version:
  - Dr. Benjamin Mullet
  - Enrique Miguel del Castillo (Ph.D. candidate, Stanford University)
